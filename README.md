# Twitter_backend

## Description

A full-stack Twitter clone app built using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a running MongoDB instance.

### Configuration

Create file `server/.env` and update the values of your configuration.

### Installing

Install server dependencies

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install
```

### Start the server in development mode

```bash
$ cd server
$ nodemon index.js
```

If everything was successful, you should see the messages being displayed in the terminal, telling that the server has successfully connected to a MongoDB and runs on a given port.

Now, the backend should be running on `http://localhost:4000`.
